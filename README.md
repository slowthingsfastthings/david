machine-learning
================

A collection of machine learning modules in python with sci-kit

Inside /modules are two scripts that perform all current tasks:

 - predict.py:  this is the wrapper through which all tasks are run.  Specify what module to run during call(ie, python predict.py crossVal)

 - modules.py:  contains all modules.  Will probably break into seperate files depending on task in the future.
